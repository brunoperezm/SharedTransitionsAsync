# SharedTransitionsAsync
This project is made to show a problem using the picasso library and shared transitions

I have set the return animation to last 5secs to properly see what is happening in the animation as well as setting a green background to see the ImaveView size
Both images are being loaded using Picasso asyncronously.

The problem is the return animation. The ImageView resizes as it should. The problem is that the image that is rendered by Picasso does not resize properly.
